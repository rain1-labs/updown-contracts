    //
    // 2026-05-13 Data Streams swap (gate 1):
    //
    // Pre-swap (PR-10 / P0-16): the resolver consumed Chainlink Data Feeds
    // via `AggregatorV3Interface.getRoundData(roundId)`, with the off-chain
    // helper computing the canonical round whose `updatedAt <= endTime` and
    // whose `roundId + 1` postdates `endTime`. That model required scanning
    // round history on-chain (two `getRoundData` calls per resolve), suffered
    // a 1h `MAX_STALENESS` cliff that caused the 2026-05-06 shadow-market
    // class (`audit-fixes/AUDIT_FINDING_CHECKUPKEEP_GAS_LEAK.md`), and was
    // structurally limited by Data Feeds' heartbeat-driven publishing.
    //
    // Post-swap: the resolver consumes Chainlink Data Streams. The off-chain
    // `ChainlinkResolverService` fetches a signed `ReportV3` blob from the
    // Streams REST API (`api.dataengine.chain.link/api/v1/reports`) at the
    // market's `endTime` and submits it as `signedReport` calldata. The
    // resolver:
    //
    //   1. Validates market state (registered, not resolved, past endTime).
    //   2. Checks the sequencer (same Arbitrum L2 pattern as before).
    //   3. Looks up the per-pair Streams feed-id from `streamsFeedId`.
    //   4. Pays the LINK fee to the FeeManager (when configured) — Option A
    //      funding model: resolver holds its own LINK balance.
    //   5. Calls `verifierProxy.verify(signedReport, parameterPayload)`. The
    //      proxy validates the DON signature, deducts the fee, and returns
    //      the decoded report.
    //   6. Decodes as `ReportV3`. Validates feedId match, expiresAt, and
    //      that `observationsTimestamp` is within the
    //      `[endTime - MAX_REPORT_OBSERVATION_LAG, endTime]` bracket.
    //   7. Computes winningOption from `report.price` vs `info.strikePrice`.
    //   8. Hands off to `settlement.resolve` under the same try/catch
    //      pattern as before — `ResolveFailed` event preserves the
    //      auditable failure path.
    //
    // Authorized + deterministic (F-2026-17760): only an authorized caller
    // (the resolver service, or the owner) can submit, and only a report
    // (a) for the right pair, (b) within the observation window, (c) not
    // expired, and (d) signed by the DON produces a successful resolve. The
    // window is now an owner-tunable `maxReportObservationLag` (default 3s,
    // hard-capped at `OBSERVATION_LAG_CAP`); reports within it yield
    // ~identical prices for sub-second Crypto streams, and the access gate
    // removes the prior permissionless favorable-report front-run. See
